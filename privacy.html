            <h2>Server Locations.</h2>
            <p>We are headquartered in San Francisco. We host our servers and process information in the United States and other countries. When you access our Sites, you transmit information to the United States and other countries.</p>
            <h2>Information We Collect.</h2>
            <p>Information you actively provide: When you register for an account or send us requests through the Site, we may ask you to provide your first and last name, height, weight, birth date, personal photo, email address, postal addresses, and password.</p>
            <p>Information you automatically provide: When you access our Site, your computer or other device also automatically provides us with certain technical information that we use to respond to your requests and render our Sites to you, including your Internet protocol address ("IP address"), browser type, domain names, access times, operating system, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), device type, operating system, device ID, language preferences, the amount of time you spend on our site, and your interactions with our site (e.g., clicks, scrolls, hovers).</p>

This type of information is collected to make our products and services more useful to you. In some of our emails to you, we will use a "click-through URL" to make your experience as easy as possible. When you click on one of these URLs, our web server detects that you clicked on the link from your email before arriving at your destination website. Tracking click-throughs helps us determine your interest in particular topics and helps us measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.
